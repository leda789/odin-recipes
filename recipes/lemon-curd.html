    <p>Lemon curd is a thick, tangy, sweet and sour custard that is often given as a gift for the holidays. It is served on scones, in deserts, or even enjoyed by itself much like a pudding.
    </p>
    <p>Originally, lemon curd did orignally have curds in it. It was just a lemony cream that was used to form curds which could then be seperated from they have. It was more like a cheese than a custard. Going back even further, it was literally called <em>lemon cheese</em>. Clearly, we have come a long way since then.
    </p>
    <p>Custard mainly consists of tempered eggs. You can technically make it if you do not have a thermometer, but it is really easy to over or under cook it, either of which is really unappetizing. As a rule of thumb, I've found that if it starts smelling a lot like eggs, stop cooking it. Also, it is very important that everything is at room temperature. It won't turn out otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>Side note: you can substitute the lemon juice for nearly any other juice to make a different fruit curd! Keep in mind that fruits that are not as strong tasting may require more juice, resulting in a more runny curd.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups sugar (250 grams)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks plus one large egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <p><strong>All ingredients should be at room temperature.</strong></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter for one minute, then add the salt and sugar. We aren't exactly going to cream the mixture just yet, but it needs to be well combined, so mix it again for another minute.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg yolks (not the whole egg, save it for later) and mix slowly until incorporated. Now we are going to cream our mixture until it is light and fluffy. If you are using a machine to mix it, put it on medium speed and mix for 3-4 minutes. If you do not have one, you will have to mix it vigorously by hand with a fork about 6-8 minutes, depending on how energetic you are.</li>
        <li>Add the whole egg and slowly mix until just combined. Then, slowly add the lemon juice until just combined. Make sure scrape the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture into a medium sauce pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a spatula, until the curd becomes very thick, about 10 minutes, or registers 170 F on a thermometer. The mixture should coat a spatula at this point.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve (not a strainer) into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, making sure the wrap sits directly on the curd to prevent it from forming a skin. It is ready to eat when it is chilled. It will stay good in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
