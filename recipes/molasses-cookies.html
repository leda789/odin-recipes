    <p>Molasses cookies are soft, chewy, seasonal cookies that originate in America. Despite the name being <en>molasses</en> cookies, these cookies include several spices that warm the palette. These indlude cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe is made like a normal cookie recipe up until the batter is done. Before rolling up your cookies and putting them in the oven, you'll want to put them in the fridge for about an hour. Waiting for cookies can be diffcult, but it is important to make the fat in the cookies cold before we put it in the oven. This prevents them from over spreading in the oven, creating a crispy, oily cookie.
    </p>
    <p>You will also need to set aside an extra 1/3 cup of white sugar to roll  balls of dough in. Sugar naturally makes baked goods drier. By rolling the outside of the cookie in it, it prevents the cookie from becoming too soft and being soggy. It also gives the cookie a nice crunch, as well as the crinkling seen on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, make sure to not immediately put your cookies away after baking. You can eat them about five minutes after they come out of the oven, however, if you put the cookies in a tupperware container, they will become soggy. The cookies need time to cool off so they don't keep too much moisture inside. Just give them around half an hour and they should be good to put away.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 and 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar, and an extra 1/3 cup white sugar for rolling.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 large egg, preferably at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt together until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of white sugar. If you have a robot for this, it will take about 2 minutes on high speed, otherwise, beat vigorously with a fork until it is fully combined and slightly lighter than when you started mixing (about 2-5 minutes). Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until combines. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly, or on a low speed, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. The dough will be a bit sticky. Cover dough tightly with foil or plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge for an hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahreheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough happened to chill longer than 2 hours, let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. The cookies may not spread enough in the oven if the dough is that cold. Roll cookie dough, 1 tablespoon each, into balls. Roll each in granulated sugar and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges appear set.</li>
        <li>Remove carefully from oven and allow cookies to cool a minimum of 5 minutes before eating. To store them, wait at least 30 minutes if you want to put them in a container. They will stay good at room temperature for a week.</li>
    </ol>
