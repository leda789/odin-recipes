    <p>Cranberries are a small tart fruit whose harvesting time is from October to December. This, along with it's vibrant red color, makes it a perfect fruit for the holiday time. While you can use cranberries for just about anything (cakes, salads, stuffing, etc.), they go amazing with a breakfast scone. The orange in the recipe helps to not only balance out the sweetness, but give it a brighter flavor.

    <p>This recipe is for American scones, not British ones. British scones are much like sweeter versions of American biscuits, and an American scone is like a muffin that is drier, buttery, and crispy on the outside. American scones are to be eaten alone, while British ones are split open and spread with jam and cream. This doesn't mean that American scones are boring though. With this recipe, we not only add cranberry and orange inside the scone, we'll also add an orange icing.

    <p>In order to make a good scone that won't dry your mouth like a sponge, you need to use a thick liquid to keep it together. Buttermilk, heavy cream, and coconut cream all work. Using regular milk will make your scones flat and dry. Similarly, using white sugar, or any sugar with similar sized grains, as a topping for your scone will make it dry. Only use turbinado (sugar in the raw), demerara sugar, or sugars with larger grains to top it. Otherwise, omit the sugar on top all together. It won't affect the flavor of the scones; the sugar simply adds a nice crunch on top.

    <p>Lastly, it is important to make sure the butter for the scones is cold. It needs to be frozen. It will melt while you are working with it
