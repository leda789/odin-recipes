This project is a collection of web pages that I created in order to help me learn through repitition. This also demonstrates my basic knowledge of HTML. This includes a boilerplate, head, paragraphs, italics and bold, headings, anchors, images, and lists.

Coincidentally, I also wanted to be a baker, but unfortunately, my feet are messed up so I couldn't follow that dream. This gave me a way to at least express my love for the art.
